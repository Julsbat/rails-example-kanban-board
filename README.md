# README

This is the 'Kanban Board' example app.
See https://backend-development.github.io/rails_view_and_controller.html

=== Study the Models ===

This Application already has two models: boards and cards.
Create the database and load the seed data by running
`rails db:setup`

=== Replace the Homepage === 

Redirect home to the list of kanban boards.

=== dependent models ===

Cards depend on their board and are deleted when the board
is deleted.  Delete a board and study the log file: how are the
cards deleted? Does Rails use referential integrity in the
database?

Rails allows us to easily set up these implied relationships, but does nothing to help us enforce referential integrity. Itâ€™s very simple to accidentally or intentionally break referential integrity in most Rails applications.


=== Nested Ressources === 

Study the URLs, controllers and actions by running `rails 
routes`. Now change `config/routes.rb` to 

    resources :boards do
      resources :cards
    end

How do the URLs change?

=== Changes in `cards_controller` ===

Change the card_controller to
always read `params[:board_id]`.  You can use
a `before_action` to do that!

The index-action should
only show cards of this board.  

When creating or updating a card
there should be no input-field for `board_id` in the form,
the `board_id` is already specified by the url.


=== Display the Kanban Board ===

Research what a kanban board shold look like.
Change the show-view of board to look like this.
